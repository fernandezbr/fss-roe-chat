# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lambda Function Parameter Mismatch
**File:** `tests/test_foundry.py`
**Issue:** Mock lambda functions only accepted one parameter (`key`) but `cl.user_session.get()` was called with two parameters (`key`, `default`)
**Fix:** Updated all lambda functions to accept default parameter: `lambda key, default=None`

### 2. Missing Session Keys
**File:** `tests/test_foundry.py`
**Issue:** Mock user sessions were missing required keys that the foundry module expects
**Fix:** Added missing keys to mock session data:
- `file_uploads`
- `file_contents` 
- Updated dictionary access to use default parameter

### 3. File Upload Structure Mismatch
**File:** `tests/test_foundry.py`
**Issue:** Tests provided file uploads as simple strings, but code expected dictionaries with structure: `{"name": str, "mime": str, "path": str, "base64": str}`
**Fix:** Updated test mocks to use proper file upload structure

### 4. Mock Object Iteration Issues
**File:** `tests/test_foundry.py`
**Issue:** Code used `"key" in mock_object` but Mock objects don't support the `in` operator by default
**Fix:** Added `__contains__` method to mocks:
- Image content mock: `mock_image_content.__contains__ = lambda self, key: key == "file_id"`
- Annotation mock: `mock_annotation.__contains__ = lambda self, key: key == "url_citation"`

### 5. File Path Issues in Utils Tests
**File:** `tests/test_utils.py` and `utils/utils.py`
**Issue:** Tests used non-existent file paths, and foundry provider logic was commented out
**Fix:** 
- Created real test file and updated test to use it
- Implemented foundry-specific file handling logic in `utils.py`
- Updated test assertions to match new file name

## Code Changes Made

### utils/utils.py
- Uncommented and fixed foundry provider detection
- Added logic to skip markdown conversion for foundry providers (non-image files)
- Maintained backward compatibility for other providers

### tests/test_foundry.py
- Fixed all lambda function signatures to accept default parameters
- Updated all mock user session data to include required keys
- Fixed file upload mocks to use proper dictionary structure
- Added `__contains__` methods to mocks for iteration support

### tests/test_utils.py  
- Updated mock file path to use real test file
- Fixed test assertion to match updated file name
